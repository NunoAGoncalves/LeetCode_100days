# LeetCode 100 days

A LeetCode question a day for a hundred days. Ongoing development. 1/100 so far. 

This is a repository that holds all the LeetCode questions I completed in this 100-day challenge.

I decided to commit to this challenge as I personally felt that my coding ability was mediocre at best – and I wanted to improve. I have been stuck on the same level of programming for about 4 years now, so I felt like the time was right to kick it up a notch. 

In this repository, I have stored the LeetCode questions in a text file format. This makes submitting the completed question easier as I won't have to open up a dedicated program for each programming language I decided to use for the challenge. I can stick with a text file format for every question.
